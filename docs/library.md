## Creating creatures

>Creatures are all entities created through the Monster or NPC and the Player Character menus. In this documentation, the term ‘Creature’ is used to refer to any creature created in the Monster or NPC and Player Character creation menus, and are stored in the Compendium under Monsters and Player Characters.

You can create creatures in *two ways*. In this example, we use the Monster creature type, but the process is the same to create Player Characters.

*First*, you can select the ![button-insert][button-insert] insert button in the bottom left of your screen, select the type of creature you’d like to create and hit ![add][icon-add] on the top right of the screen.

Or, you can select the Library icon ![library][icon-library] in the top right of your screen. From here select Players, then select the ![add][icon-add] icon in the top right.

From the Compendium, you can create additional entries such as items and spells, or even campaigns and modules - for more information about using the Compendium, click here

Either method you choose, you will now have the option to create Monsters or NPCs or Player Characters.
