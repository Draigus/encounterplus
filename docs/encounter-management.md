# Encounter Management

Encounter Plus is a great way to manage any combat encounter. It’s designed to quickly add creatures or NPCs as well Player Characters on the fly. It’s also designed to keep track of various conditions both positive and negative for each creature and player in an encounter. 

### Before Combat

Adding Creatures and players
**1.** Tap ![Insert][icon-insert] in the bottom right corner of the Encounter Plus app. 
**2.** Choose between the following:
	* **Monster or NPC**: This will open the built-in compendium for all the creatures stored within Encounter Plus.
	
***Note:** The only included creatures in the compendium are from the Basic Rules Set in compliance with Wizard’s of the Coast Open Game License v1.0a*

* **Player Character**: This will add any Player Characters that have been added to the Encounter Plus Compendium. 

	***Note:** Players can be added to the compendium via tapping on the ![Compendium][icon-library] icon in the top right of the app.*

* **Party from Campaign**: This will add whole parties of Player Characters if they have been added to a particular campaign in the compendium. 
	
	***Note:** Player Characters can be added to a campaign by tapping on the campaign in the compendium ![compendium][icon-library]. Then tap the [Edit] button to add players to that particular campaign. This gives one tap capability to add groups of PCs.*

3. Once a particular creature or PC is tapped on in the Compendium, a creature description will be seen. This will display all the stats and abilities of that creature. Tap the ![Checkmark][icon-load] to add that creature. 

***Note:** The ![Checkmark][icon-load] can be tapped multiple times to add many of the same creature to a combat encounter.*

### Starting Combat

*Note that the difficulty of the encounter is at the bottom of the app interface. This will allow customization of the size of the encounter to best suit the Player Characters.*

* **Tap Start** to start the encounter. This will roll initiative for all the enemies in the encounter. Note that the initiative settings can be changed by tapping on the ![settings][icon-settings] icon in the top left of the app interface. This customizes how initiative is rolled for the creatures in the combat.

***Note:** By default the app doesn’t roll initiative for the Player Characters. If desired, the app can roll for the PCs as well. Tap on the ![settings][icon-settings] and change that setting.*

### Managing Combat

* Manage the encounter by tapping on the ![Initiative Order][icon-initiative] icon. 
* For Player Characters, manually add their initiative into the Initiative block if the app is not rolling for their characters.
* Creature and character health are tracked here as well. Tap on the creatures health and type in the amount of damage that creature has taken into the **Damage Calculator**. It will automatically subtract. Tap anywhere on the screen to dismiss the Damage Calculator.

*Tap on the **MOD** button in the Damage Calculator to change the number to healing as opposed to damage.*

* Once combat has started you can edit or change the conditions of the creatures by swiping from right to left on creature in the initiative order. 
* Tapping the ![pencil][icon-pencil] tool will give the ability to name, change label, hide, adjust HP, or adjust light of that creature. Additional notes can also be added if desired. 
* Tapping on the ![Condition][icon-condition] tool will allow you to add conditions to the creature. Additional Customer Descriptions can be written in. The duration and source of the condition can also be added in if relevant.  

***Note:** Once conditions are added they can be tapped on under the creature in the Initiative Order to see the effects of that conditional as well and delete when necessary.*

* Tapping on the ![Arrows][icon-next] in the bottom right corner of the app interface once the Combat has started will highlight the next or previous creature in the intitiative order to keep track of turns. 

### Ending Combat

* Once the combat has concluded, tap the ![Stop][icon-stop] button in the lower left corner of the interface and the combat will end. Combat can resume if the [Start] button is tapped and combat will resume at where the initiative last left off. 

***Note:** Combat can be toggled on or off at will. Combat does have to be stopped in order to add additional creatures to the combat. When ![Start][icon-start] is tapped there is an option to re-roll initiative. Tap **Later** if combat is to be resumed without a re-rolling of initiative.*
