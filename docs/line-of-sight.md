### Drawing Walls

You can draw walls with ![pencil][icon-pencil] or ![highlighter][icon-highlighter]. Try using *Rectangle* or *Line* style for rectangular corridors, and *Freehand* style for caverns.

Use ![snap][icon-snap] to toggle Snap to Grid mode. Note that *Freehand* does not snap to grid.

*Pro TIP - Cyan colored walls will block Line of Sight, but not movement.*

### Walls Generator

You can use *Walls Generator* tool to quickly generate walls and obstacles for Line of Sight based on walkable floors. Itâ€™s ideal for dungeons with rectangular corridors.

1. Tap ![settings][icon-settings].
2. Tap *Walls Generator*.
3. Adjust parameters.
	* **Wall Offset** - offset from other side of wall.
	* **Floor Color** - only use floors with selected color.
	* **Continuous** - if enabled, each wall will be generated as a single continuous line, otherwise it will be divided into separate segments.
4. Tap Generate.

*Pro TIP - You can experiment with parameters by using this tool multiple times. All previously generated walls will be replaced.*
