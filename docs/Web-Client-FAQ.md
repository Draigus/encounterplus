FAQ Web Client for Encounter Plus

# How does the Web Client work?
The device that is running the game can act as a server for other players to connect to either locally or over the internet. Just go into the external display setting located in the top left of E+ and turn it on.

### Why doesnâ€™t the URL E+ gives me work?
**There are two parts to this question.** Part one: you need to **open port 8080 on your router** for the IP address E+ is displaying. That needs to be done on your router. **Please refer to your routers user manual** for information on how to change port settings. Part two: The IP address that is given to you within E+ is just the devices IP address. **You need to find the the IP address provided to you by your Internet Service Provider.** A good place to find that is whatsmyip.org. Now that you have opened port 8080 and you know your actual IP address, players can connect to you using the URL **http://client.encounter.plus?remoteHost=[your IP Address]:8080**

### I opened the port and got my IP address, but it still says Websocket Disconnected when players try to join.
This can happen when **browsers automatically redirect to https://client.encounter.plus instead of http://client.encounter.plus.** Try turning on **incognito mode in Chrome or Private Browsing in Safari** to keep it from redirecting. If your browser is still redirecting to https, **try clearing your browser history.** 

**Note: Currently, only Safari and Chrome have been tested for the E+ Web Client.** 

### All or some of my tokens aren't appearing on the web client.
**Try moving the tokens around to refresh them** on the web client side. If that doens't work, **try turing off web server in E+ and turning it back on.** Once this is done **have the players reconnect.** 

### What are the different settings in the web server section of E+?
Those allow the DM to control how many people can interact with the tokens onscreen at any given point. When it is set to **All**, then anyone can move tokens at anytime. Setting it to **Turn Only** will only allow tokens to move on their turn. Setting it to **None** will only allow the DM to move tokens. 

### Known Issues

There is no way to kick players from the server.
