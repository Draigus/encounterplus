# Campaigns & Modules

### Campaigns and Modules

In the **Compendium** ![load][icon-library], materials for managing campaigns can be accessed. Documents can be created, maps can be organized, and encounters can be saved. All of the creatures and Player Characters are managed here as well. This article will focus on managing **Campaigns**, which are whole adventures for the Player Characters. This will also apply to **Modules** which are small bite-sized adventures that can be inserted into larger campaigns.

### Creating a Campaign

Creating a campaign is the first step in planning a larger long-term adventure for the Player Characters. A campaign can consist of **Maps**, **Pages**, and **Encounters**. You can **Group** these files together into folders.

1. Tap on the ![Compendium][icon-library].

	***Campaigns**, **Modules**, and **Asset Packs** can be added here. Player Characters as well as items, gear, spells, and monsters can be also added to the Compendium.*

2. Tap the **Campaigns** button.
3. Tap the ![add][icon-add] button to add a new campaign. This is where the title can be set and a description can be added. **Modules** can also be inserted and Player Characters can be assigned.

*Inserting Player Characters into a campaign makes it easier to add a group of Player Characters to an Encounter or Map.*

### Managing a Campaign

Once a Campaign is created the planning phase begins. As stated above, the following files can be added to a campaign:

* **Pages**: These are going to be documents that can include anything that the DM needs to keep track of: events, NPCs, character arcs, and anything else that needs to be written down.
* **Encounters**: Adding encounters lets the DM pre-plan who/what the Player Characters will face. Creating an encounter will prompt a name, description, and combatants. Based on the Player Characters in the campaign, Encounter will state the difficulty.
* **Maps**: Maps can be hand drawn using the tools built into Encounter+. Maps can also be imported from the **Photos App** or the **Files App**. These maps can then be drawn on. Markers can also be added by double-tapping in the map. This will add a marker to the spot that was double-tapped.

*The use of Maps can be unlocked via the in-app purchase in the ![Settings][icon-settings] or via the in-app **Subscription**.*
